# Project Details

This README provides an overview of the key components and technologies used in this project.

## Technologies Used

- SCSS for styling

- For Authentication i used Express JS and Mongo DB
- Express JS to get Appointments + Accept / Decline
- Mock Api For Patients and Medical History
- Dummy Data For Messages

- Apex Charts for dashboard charts
- react-data-table-component for data tables

- Custom calendar from scratch in dashboard
- Custom pagination component
- Custom timeline in Patient Details

## To Consider

Uploading Profile Picture is working perfectly from Frontend but After Uploading the Profile Picture It'll be deleted after minutes from the Node JS Server and that's something is not in my hand but you'll be able to see the picture in the first minutes

## Missing Parts From Figma Design

I did not implement Appointment Calendar because all i did not find library and if i find they're not free and i did not have enough time to create one from scratch
