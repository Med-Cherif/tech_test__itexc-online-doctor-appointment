# Project Details

This README provides an overview of the key components and technologies used in this project.

## Technologies Used

- SCSS for styling
- For Authentication i used Express JS and Mongo DB

- Mock Api For Patients and Medical History
- Apex Charts for dashboard charts
- react-data-table-component for data tables
- Custom calendar from scratch in dashboard
- Custom pagination component
- Custom timeline in Patient Details

## Missing Parts From Figma Design

- I did not implement Appointment Calendar because all i did not find library and if i find they're not free and i did not have enough time to create one from scratch
